									<h1>A few words<br />
									about who i am</h1>
									<p>Hello! I am Charalambos, but everyone that knows me calls me Harry.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I was born in 1999 in Patras and grew up in the small town of Amaliada. Growing up I was always interested in science and technology and would constantly bombard all adults around me with questions about the universe
									As well as requests to use their gadgets and phones. I was also profoundly interested in computers and started assembling and using  them from the age of 11. I also spent a profound amount of time playing video games both on PC as well as game consoles.
									Right around that time, I also discovered that I was naturally talented in the English language and even to this day I still believe that I am a lot more comfortable using English than I am using my mother language of Greek.
									At the age of 18 I started studying to become a merchant marine officer in the naval academy of Chania, but soon after I realised that my calling lay elsewhere and I dropped out.
									One year later, at the age of 19 I joined the university of Patras to study in the department of management science and technology. 
									A bachelors program that is focused on general business knowledge on the one hand, and programming as well as business intelligence on the other.
									Whilst studying for my degree I discovered my passion for statistics, programming and economics and tried to deepen my knowledge on all three subjects. I completed several school coursework using the R programming language rather than SPSS, the statistical software usually employed by my school.
